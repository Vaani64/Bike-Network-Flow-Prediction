# Bike-Network-Flow-Prediction
This project leverages social network analysis (SNA) and historical bike-sharing data to enhance the prediction of urban bike network flow and optimize transportation systems. The primary objective is to develop a hybrid model that accurately forecasts bike availability, demand, and congestion, addressing the limitations of traditional prediction methods which often fail to account for dynamic factors like social interactions and events.

The approach integrates diverse data sources—including bike usage, social media interactions related to local events, and external weather data—to model the bike network as a graph. Employing machine learning techniques such as LSTM and time series forecasting, the project demonstrates that the hybrid model significantly outperforms traditional baseline models.

Key findings show improved accuracy (measured by MAE, RMSE, and R 
2
 ) in real-time demand forecasting, particularly during peak times and events, due to the incorporation of social behavioral patterns. The successful implementation of this model offers substantial potential for enhanced urban mobility, optimized bike distribution, reduced congestion, and improved resource allocation for bike-sharing operators and city planners. Future work will focus on integrating additional data sources and developing real-time prediction systems for broader urban applications.
